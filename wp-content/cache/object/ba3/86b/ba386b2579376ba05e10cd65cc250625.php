				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">Extend Chilled Water Loop<br />
Kansas City, MO (2019 ‚Äì 2020) </p>
<p>This project involved the extension of the chilled water piping for the Kansas City, MO VAMC to accommodate the facility‚Äôs needs for future projects as well as to tie-in existing buildings to the central plant. The new chilled water piping is installed in a below-ground culvert, which includes additional space for futures installation of steam pipe and electrical conduit for future projects.<br />
 The scope of this project also included the remediation of problematic instability with the chilled water system which coincided with its poor performance due to ‚ÄúLow Delta-T‚Äù syndrome. Research and analysis of data collected by the DDC¬†control system led to insights that allowed 21 Delta Engineers to prescribe a path of corrective actions. The VAMC engineering and maintenance personnel followed these recommendations and, the problematic issues were corrected. Additional sensors were included in the new design so the facility will be able to more effectively monitor the differential pressures and flow characteristic of the chilled water loop into the future.</p></div>

Marion, Illinois VA Medical Center<br />
(2019-2020)</p>
<p> This project included the redesign and resurfacing of the Marion, IL VAMC parking lot. The existing parking lot was unconducive to the flow of traffic and pedestrians, and a top priority was to thus improve the layout so to eliminate safety concerns.<br />
  In addition to the redesign of the parking surface and layout, new lighting poles and fixtures were included in the design to ensure better visibility¬†for both drivers and pedestrians. A surveillance camera network was also added that provides full coverage of the parking area and other capabilities that improve their existing security infrastructure. Moreover, bollards and a security access gate were specified to restrict access and control traffic flow.<br />
  Both the traffic and wayfaring signage around the campus were updated and redesigned to comply with the current VA and Federal standards. The signage was customized to facilitate more efficient the flow of the traffic, to more effectively direct visitors to the facility to their desired destination, as well as to improve the overall safety and reduce hazards.<br />
 As shown by the drawings below, a dedicated emergency vehicle lane ensures that ambulances are able to quickly route through the parking lot without being impeded by, or risking collision with, vehicles backing out or waiting to pull into parking spots. Additional disabled parking spots were required to be incorporated into the design to come into compliance with the current standards. The project is designed to be completed in phases to maintain a 2/3 capacity of the parking lot during construction.</p></div>

Wichita, Kansas (2017)<br />
 21 Delta Engineer‚Äôs designed an electrical power distribution with 480 V and 120/208 V service and the ability to integrate future access to the 12470 power source. The design also included a tie-in connection to the service panel at Building 60, as well as distribution panels located in the penthouse and a power feed terminating midway on the roof of the connecting corridor.</div>

Hot Springs, South Dakota VA Medical Center<br />
(2016 ‚Äì 2018)</p>
<p>This project involved the replacement of the existing air handling system serving the SPS. The design was required to accommodate the limited space dedicated for installation the air handling equipment and periphery components.<br />
 The existing air handling was undersized which led to issues with respect to the satisfying the required air changes per VA design criteria. The lack of zoned control of the existing system also contributed to the difficulties in maintaining required differential pressure. Given the sensitive lab work being performed in the spaces served by the air handler, it is critical that the negative differential pressure be maintained. Also, the excessive humidity during the summer months, thus establishing the requirement that the new system provide more efficient dehumidification to effectively meet the demands of the areas¬†served.<br />
 The space above the existing acoustical ceilings was extremely limited and required removal and reinstallation of the ceiling to accommodate new ductwork which also required some existing piping to be relocated.<br />
 21 Delta Engineers furnished construction drawings and specifications which detailed the scope of work to be performed. In addition to replacement of the existing air handling and condensing units, the design also included modifications to the ductwork and electrical components. Whereas the existing air handling system served only a single zone; the new system provides separate zones with humidifiers and reheat coils to facilitate precise control for each room served. The new unit incorporates a pre-cooler to facilitate more precise and efficient dehumidification. The new system succeeded in remedying the deficiencies.</div>

Fort Meade, South Dakota VA Medical Center<br />
(2018 &#8211; 2019)</p>
<p>The Burner Management System (BMS), Combustion Control System (CCS), and Plantmaster boiler controls were replaced for three watertube boilers that provide steam and hot water for Fort Meade VAMC campus. New flame detection equipment were also installed, along with emergency sensors and annunciators, to bring the 50+ year old equipment into compliance with the latest standards and regulations. The 20+ year-old control modules were replaced with start-of-the-art touchscreen displays. The intent of the project was to seamlessly integrate the new technology with the existing equipment with minimal disruption to the boiler plant‚Äôs operations.<br />
 21 Delta Engineer‚Äôs worked with Rockwell Automation‚Äôs Industrial Combustion and Steam Generation Application‚Äôs Group (ICSG) to perform the rigorous integration testing for all of the combustion components and systems. The factory acceptance testing required testing of every input/output point in the system, along with each aspect of the software and hardware.<br />
 The work was completed in stages to ensure the boilers remained operational while the upgrades were performed. Several unanticipated technical issues were rectified promptly to ensure this time sensitive project was completed on schedule. Extensive training was provided to instruct the boiler operators regarding proper operation of the new systems.</p></div>

Leavenworth, KS VA Medical Center<br />
(2019 &#8211; 2020)<br />
 The steam and condensate distribution piping were replaced throughout campus, much of which was located in underground tunnels connecting various buildings at the facility. The project required demolition and removal of decades old piping, including asbestos abatement. Temporary Boilers were utilized to satisfy the campus‚Äôs steam demand during construction.<br />
 The project also included the installation of new mechanical and upgraded electrical systems serving several buildings, including a VRF (Variable Refrigerant Flow) system.</p></div>
